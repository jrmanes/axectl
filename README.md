Piktoctl has the command `sonar` which allows you to have a **SonarQube** in your local dev env.

There are different options for `sonar`:

piktoctl sonar -i
```

- Start the service, creating the projects and scan them
```bash
piktoctl sonar -s -c --scan -p "someProject" -o "someOrganization"
```

- Start the service
```bash
piktoctl sonar -s -p "someProject" -o "someOrganization"
```

- Start the service creating the projects
```bash
piktoctl sonar -s -c -p "someProject" -o "someOrganization"
```

- Check the status of the service 
```bash
piktoctl sonar --status 
```
